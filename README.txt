Goal is to have LED implementation for RGB LED on STM32 very similar to generic LED interface. SIMILARITY IS IMPORTANT for simple transition between microcontrollers.

NOTE: Tests shown in Iontra_RGB_LED_INTF.c and STM32_RGB_LED_INTF.c are NOT EXHAUSTIVE/THOROUGH. I created them mostly to test myself, but if I had more time
I would've created more tests to try to exhaustively check to ensure everything works properly.
